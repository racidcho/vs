# CSS Loading Issue Fix and Testing Report

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED: Tailwind CSS Loading Successfully

### Problem Summary
The application was experiencing PostCSS configuration errors preventing Tailwind CSS from loading correctly. The error message was:
```
[postcss] It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package...
```

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by incompatible configuration for Tailwind CSS v4.1.11. The project was using the new Tailwind CSS v4, which has significantly different configuration requirements compared to v3.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Updated PostCSS Configuration
Fixed `postcss.config.js`:
```javascript
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
  },
}
```

#### 2. Updated CSS Import for Tailwind v4
Changed `src/index.css` from v3 format:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components; 
@tailwind utilities;
```

To v4 format:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

#### 3. Migrated Theme Configuration
Converted `tailwind.config.js` theme settings to CSS custom properties in `@theme` block:
```css
@theme {
  --color-primary-50: #fdf2f8;
  --color-primary-500: #ec4899;
  /* ... other theme variables */
}
```

#### 4. Updated Component Styles
Converted utility-based component styles to standard CSS for better v4 compatibility.
