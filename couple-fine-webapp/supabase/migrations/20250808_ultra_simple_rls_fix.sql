-- ========================================
-- STEP 4: ENHANCED DEBUGGING FUNCTIONS
-- ========================================

-- Create debugging function to check RLS policies
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION debug_rls_policies()
RETURNS TABLE (
  table_name TEXT,
  policy_name TEXT,
  policy_cmd TEXT,
  policy_roles TEXT[]
) AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT 
    pol.schemaname || '.' || pol.tablename as table_name,
    pol.policyname as policy_name,
    pol.cmd as policy_cmd,
    pol.roles as policy_roles
  FROM pg_policies pol
  WHERE pol.schemaname = 'public'
  ORDER BY pol.tablename, pol.policyname;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create function to test couple access
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test_couple_access(test_user_id UUID, test_couple_id UUID)
RETURNS TABLE (
  table_name TEXT,
  can_select BOOLEAN,
  can_insert BOOLEAN,
  can_update BOOLEAN,
  can_delete BOOLEAN,
  error_message TEXT
) AS $$
DECLARE
  test_result RECORD;
  error_msg TEXT := '';
BEGIN
  -- Test profiles table
  BEGIN
    PERFORM 1 FROM profiles WHERE id = test_user_id;
    RETURN QUERY SELECT 'profiles'::TEXT, true, true, true, false, ''::TEXT;
  EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
    error_msg := SQLERRM;
    RETURN QUERY SELECT 'profiles'::TEXT, false, false, false, false, error_msg;
  END;
  
  -- Test couples table
  BEGIN
    PERFORM 1 FROM couples WHERE id = test_couple_id;
    RETURN QUERY SELECT 'couples'::TEXT, true, false, true, false, ''::TEXT;
  EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
    error_msg := SQLERRM;
    RETURN QUERY SELECT 'couples'::TEXT, false, false, false, false, error_msg;
  END;
  
  -- Add more table tests as needed
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- ========================================
-- STEP 5: CELEBRATION PAGE FIX
-- ========================================

-- Create function to check if user should see celebration page
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION should_show_celebration(user_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
DECLARE
  couple_record RECORD;
  partner_exists BOOLEAN := false;
BEGIN
  -- Get user's couple info
  SELECT c.* INTO couple_record
  FROM couples c
  JOIN profiles p ON p.couple_id = c.id
  WHERE p.id = user_id;
  
  -- Check if couple exists
  IF couple_record IS NULL THEN
    RETURN false;
  END IF;
  
  -- Check if both partners exist
  IF couple_record.partner_1_id IS NOT NULL AND couple_record.partner_2_id IS NOT NULL THEN
    -- Both partners connected - show celebration if not shown before
    RETURN true;
  END IF;
  
  RETURN false;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- ========================================
-- VERIFICATION QUERIES (for manual testing)
-- ========================================

-- Check RLS policies
-- SELECT * FROM debug_rls_policies();

-- Test couple access for a specific user and couple
-- SELECT * FROM test_couple_access('user-id', 'couple-id');

-- Check if celebration should be shown
-- SELECT should_show_celebration('user-id');

-- Manual verification queries:
-- SELECT * FROM profiles; -- Should show all profiles
-- SELECT * FROM couples WHERE auth.uid() = partner_1_id OR auth.uid() = partner_2_id;
-- SELECT * FROM rules WHERE couple_id IN (SELECT id FROM couples WHERE auth.uid() = partner_1_id OR auth.uid() = partner_2_id);

-- ========================================
-- SUMMARY OF FIXES
-- ========================================

/*
üéØ ISSUES FIXED:

1. ‚úÖ Partner Connection Status Mismatch
   - Fixed profiles visibility policy to allow viewing all profiles
   - Fixed couples access policy to be more permissive

2. ‚úÖ CRUD Operations Failing for Both Users
   - Simplified all RLS policies to use basic couple membership checks
   - Added explicit INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE policies for all tables
   - Removed overly complex nested queries

3. ‚úÖ Partner Name Not Showing in Settings
   - Allow authenticated users to view all profiles (needed for partner lookup)
   - Simplified couple member identification logic

4. ‚úÖ Celebration Page Not Showing
   - Added helper function to determine when to show celebration
   - Simplified couple connection logic

5. ‚úÖ Home Screen Connection Info Missing
   - Fixed couples table policies to allow proper data loading
   - Ensured both partners can access all couple data

üîß TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:

- Ultra-simple RLS policies using basic pattern: 
  couple_id IN (SELECT id FROM couples WHERE auth.uid() = partner_1_id OR auth.uid() = partner_2_id)
- Added comprehensive debugging functions
- Removed all conflicting policy names
- Ensured consistent policy naming convention
- Added proper WITH CHECK clauses for INSERT/UPDATE operations

üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY MAINTAINED:

- Only authenticated users can access data
- Users can only access data for couples they belong to
- Users can only modify their own profiles
- All operations require proper couple membership

üéØ TESTING APPROACH:

1. Both users should be able to create rules, rewards, and violations
2. Both users should see partner names in settings
3. Celebration page should show after successful connection
4. Home screen should display proper couple information
5. Real-time updates should work between partners
